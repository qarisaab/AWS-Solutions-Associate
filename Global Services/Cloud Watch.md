#### Monitoring
Cloud watch is an aws service that is used for monitoring various aws services.
It can be used to create alarms for the services according to the metrics.
The more managed the aws service the more metric and checks aws provides out of the box because you have no control over the services. If it is less managed by the aws you have to install the custom alarms yourself.
