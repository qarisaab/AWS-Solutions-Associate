#### Elastic Compute Cloud
EC2 is the secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud it is like a VM hosted in aws data center. It is designed to make web scaled cloud computing easier for the developers and it is flexible for the capacity you want when you need it. The instances are in complete control of you and it is a service that is not managed by the aws. We pay for what we use. 

### NAT for public address
ec2 uses one to one nat translation. The public IP address is associated with the private address and the instance doesn't know about the public address because it is associated with the internet gateway.

#### EC2 data and metadata
User data is the data that we can provide before starting an instance and it will run this code when the EC2 instance boots up by this we can install and configure our ec2 instance very quickly.
